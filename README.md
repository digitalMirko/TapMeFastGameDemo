Swift - Tap Me Fast Game Demo App

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Tap Me Fast Game Demo' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a blended green background with the title on top 'Tap Me Fast'. Then right below is a label where
there the time is displayed for the game. Then right below that is another label which holds your score in the game.
On the bottom is a large 'Start' button that when clicked will start the game. When the game is in play the 'Start' button
text will change into 'Tap Away'. But when the game is over the 'Restart' text is displayed.

The player clicks the 'Start' button. The timer starts to count down from 10 to 0. The object of the game is to tap 
as many times as you can on the button to get a point for each click. Once your 10 seconds are over you will have a chance
to play again by hitting the Restart button but you will have to wait 5 seconds before doing so.

Its a fun game to see how fast you are someone else is. Fun for the whole family to enjoy
